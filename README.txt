Hello everyone!

The creation of the program was aimed at studying the front-end component of C# - XAML. 

The backend has been implemented as easily as possible with a quadruple nested loop. Unlike the backend, the emphasis was on the frontend. I decided not to use the grid method when arranging windows for entering phrases, but used a combination of Grid and StackPanel. 

For the style of these windows, I had to develop my own style, and then attach it to the input windows. In addition to my own styles, I also used the MaterialDesign styles: when creating my own styles, as well as when detailing the button for creating a solution. 

It is also worth paying attention to the button for clearing the fields, which is a picture of a trash can, meaning cleaning. Anchoring the image also required manipulation of the button styles.


In conclusion, I would like to note that this is just my pet project, which was created with the aim of teaching new features to C# projects. 

Thank you for your attention!
